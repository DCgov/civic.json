# [civic.json (extended)](http://open.dc.gov/civic.json/)

So you've coded up a super awesome tool for your community. Now what? You want to share it, of course! Well, civic.json is here to help.

It's a small file you put in the base of your project's public repository. Fill it with information explaining what your project's about, its development status, who helped build it, and where people can learn more. Think of it like a structured "README" file that makes possible things like [browseable project pages](http://codefordc.org/projects/) for your organization or city.

Civic.json was originally created by BetaNYC in 2014.

Now, a group of Washington, DC residents—Code for DC volunteers and employees of the District Government—have extended their specification to make it useful for a broader user base.

In doing so, we aim to foster collaboration and reuse across government agencies, municipalities, and the citizen-government divide.

We referenced the following metadata standards as part of this project:

* [BetaNYC civic.json](https://github.com/BetaNYC/civic.json)
* [Code for America API](http://codeforamerica.org/api/#project-properties)
* [18F .about.yml](https://github.com/18F/about_yml)
* [npm package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json)
