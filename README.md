We are looking to develop a project metadata standard for DCgov (and beyond) based on civic.json, which is already in fairly wide use in volunteer civic technology communities. The aim is to foster collaboration and reuse across government agencies, municipalities, and levels, and to facilitate the same with the public.

Existing standards:

* [BetaNYC civic.json](https://github.com/BetaNYC/civic.json)
* [Code for DC civic.json](http://codefordc.org/resources/specification.html)
* [Code for America API](http://codeforamerica.org/api/#project-properties)
* [18F .about.yml](https://github.com/18F/about_yml)
* [npm package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json)
